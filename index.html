                or stacking flashy projects on GitHub. For me, it's been about something quieter (and harder):
                learning how to think.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a short snapshot of how I'm approaching that process right now — not as an expert,
                but as someone actively figuring it out.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Thinking > Tools</strong></p>
            <p>
                Early on, I thought progress meant learning more tools. New Python packages. New frameworks.
                New buzzwords. And sure, tools matter — but I've learned they're only useful once the thinking
                is already there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Math has been the biggest driver of that shift. Classes like probability, linear algebra, and
                analysis don't just teach techniques; they force precision. You learn what assumptions you're
                making, what breaks when they're wrong, and how small changes ripple through an argument.
                That mindset transfers directly to data, models, and markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, when I learn a tool, it's usually because I need it to express an idea I already have —
                not because I'm hoping the tool itself will make me smarter.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Coding as a Thinking Tool</strong></p>
            <p>
                I don't code just to "build things." I code to clarify ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I can't simulate it, I probably don't understand it. If I can't explain it in code, my
                mental model is probably fuzzy. Writing small scripts — especially for probability or data
                problems — forces me to be honest about what I actually know versus what I'm hand-waving.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why a lot of my projects are small, focused, and sometimes a little boring on the
                surface. They're not meant to impress — they're meant to sharpen intuition.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Why I Build in Public</strong></p>
            <p>
                Putting work on GitHub (even when it's imperfect) keeps me accountable. It forces me to
                finish thoughts, clean up reasoning, and document why I did something — not just what I did.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also removes the illusion that everyone else has it figured out. The difference is whether they're willing to show the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building in public isn't about showing off progress — it's about making learning visible.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Small Projects > Big Unfinished Ones</strong></p>
            <p>
                I used to think every project needed to be ambitious. Now I'm convinced the opposite is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                A clean, well-understood notebook on one idea beats a half-built "AI trading system" every
                time. Depth compounds. Shallow breadth doesn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                When something clicks — a distribution, a factor intuition, a modeling assumption — I try
                to capture it immediately, even if it's messy. Those moments are where real learning happens.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Where I'm At (Right Now)</strong></p>
            <p>
                I'm still early. I'm still confused a lot. And that's fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, my focus is on building strong mathematical intuition, using code to test and
                formalize ideas, and writing things down so future-me can see how my thinking evolved.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site is part notebook, part lab, part public record of that process.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're also figuring things out — you're probably doing it right.

            <h3>How I Decide What's Worth Learning (And What I Ignore)</h3>
            <p class="blog-date">November 14, 2025</p>
            <p>
                One of the hardest parts of learning anything technical isn't understanding the material —
                it's deciding what's worth your time in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's no shortage of things you could learn. New tools, new fields, new buzzwords, new
                threads telling you that if you don't know X by tomorrow, you're behind. Early on, I tried
                to chase all of it. That didn't last long.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, I've started using a few simple filters to decide what I actually focus on —
                and just as importantly, what I ignore.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Does This Strengthen My Thinking or Just My Toolkit?</strong></p>
            <p>
                The first question I ask is whether something strengthens how I think, or whether it just
                adds another tool to the pile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things that consistently make the cut: Math that forces precision (probability, linear
                algebra, proofs), concepts that transfer across problems, and ideas that change how I
                frame questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things that usually don't: Tools I don't have a concrete use for yet, frameworks I'm
                learning "just in case," and anything I can only use by copying patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tools are easy to pick up later. Thinking is not.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Can I Explain This Simply?</strong></p>
            <p>
                If I can't explain something in plain language — or better yet, implement a small version
                of it — I probably don't understand it well enough to justify going deeper.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where coding helps. Writing a short script or notebook forces clarity. There's no
                hiding behind vague intuition once you have to make something run.
            </p>
            <p>
                If an idea collapses the moment I try to formalize it, that's a signal to slow down —
                not move on.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Does This Compound?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Some things compound quietly. Others don't.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning a core mathematical idea tends to pay dividends across everything else. Learning
                a niche library often doesn't. That doesn't mean niche tools are bad — just that they're
                lower priority early on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I try to bias toward things that make future learning easier, unlock multiple domains at
                once, and stay relevant even as tools change.
            </p>
            <p>
                If something only helps in one narrow context, I'm comfortable skipping it for now.
            </p>

            <p><strong>What Am I Willing to Be Bad At (For Now)?</strong></p>
            <p>
                This might be the most important filter.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can't be good at everything at once. Trying to be just spreads effort thin. So I've
                gotten more comfortable explicitly choosing gaps — areas I know I'm weak in, but am
                intentionally postponing.
            </p>
            <p>
                That choice isn't permanent. It's just honest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being deliberate about what I ignore has been as valuable as deciding what to learn.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Avoiding the Distraction Loop</strong></p>
            <p>
                There's a certain kind of productivity that looks like progress but isn't. Watching videos.
                Skimming docs. Saving links. Feeling busy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I notice myself doing that, it's usually a sign I need a sharper question — not more
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning accelerates once you're solving a real problem. Until then, restraint matters
                more than curiosity.
            </p>

            <p><strong>This Will Change — and That's Fine</strong></p>
            <p>
                None of this is fixed. As my interests evolve, so will these filters.
            </p>
            <p>
                But for now, this framework keeps me grounded. It helps me say no without guilt, focus
                without panic, and learn without constantly feeling behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a world with infinite things to learn, attention is the real scarce resource.

            <h3>Why I'm More Interested in Models Than Answers</h3>
            <p class="blog-date">December 21, 2025</p>
            <p>
                For a long time, I cared a lot about answers. Getting the right result. Matching the
                solution. Knowing I was "correct."
            </p>
            <p>
                Somewhere along the way — mostly through math and probability — that shifted. Now,
                I'm far more interested in models than answers.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Answers Are Fragile</strong></p>
            <p>
                An answer is usually tied to a very specific setup. Change an assumption, tweak a
                parameter, or move slightly outside the original context, and the answer can fall apart.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn't make answers useless — it just makes them brittle.
            </p>
            <p>
                What started to bother me was how often I could get the "right" answer without really
                understanding why it was right, or when it would stop being right.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Models Force You to Be Honest</strong></p>
            <p>
                A model, even a simple one, forces clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                What assumptions are you making? What are you ignoring? What happens when those
                assumptions fail?
            </p>
            <p>
                You can't hide inside a model. If it's wrong, it breaks — sometimes loudly.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's uncomfortable, but it's also where learning happens.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Math Changed What I Pay Attention To</strong></p>
            <p>
                Proof-based math shifted my focus away from results and toward structure. You start
                caring less about the final line and more about the logic that gets you there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Probability did the same thing in a different way. Instead of asking "what will happen?",
                you ask "under what conditions does this tend to happen?" That subtle shift changes
                everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you start thinking like that, chasing isolated answers feels less satisfying.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Models Age Better Than Answers</strong></p>
            <p>
                Answers expire quickly. Models don't.
            </p>
            <p>
                A numerical result might only be useful today. A good model — even an imperfect one —
                can be adapted, stress-tested, and reused as conditions change.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why I'm drawn to understanding the shape of problems rather than memorizing
                outputs. It's also why I'm comfortable sitting with approximation instead of precision
                when precision isn't justified.
            </p>

            <p><strong>This Changes How I Learn</strong></p>
            <p>
                When I study something new, I'm less concerned with mastering every technique and
                more concerned with what assumptions are being made, what problem this is really
                solving, and where this model breaks down.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I can answer those, the details tend to fall into place later.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Especially in Uncertain Systems</strong></p>
            <p>
                Markets, data, and real-world systems don't reward answer-chasing. They reward people
                who understand structure, limitations, and uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                A clean answer can be comforting. A useful model is more valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's the level I'm trying to operate on — even if it means being less certain,
                more often.
