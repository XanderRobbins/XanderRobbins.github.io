            </div>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>One of the hardest parts of learning anything technical isn't understanding the material — it's deciding what's worth your time in the first place.</p>

                <p>There's no shortage of things you could learn. New tools, new fields, new buzzwords, new threads telling you that if you don't know X by tomorrow, you're behind. Early on, I tried to chase all of it. That didn't last long.</p>

                <p>Over time, I've started using a few simple filters to decide what I actually focus on — and just as importantly, what I ignore.</p>

                <h2>Does This Strengthen My Thinking or Just My Toolkit?</h2>

                <p>The first question I ask is whether something strengthens how I think, or whether it just adds another tool to the pile.</p>

                <p>Things that consistently make the cut: Math that forces precision (probability, linear algebra, proofs), concepts that transfer across problems, and ideas that change how I frame questions.</p>

                <p>Things that usually don't: Tools I don't have a concrete use for yet, frameworks I'm learning "just in case," and anything I can only use by copying patterns.</p>

                <p>Tools are easy to pick up later. Thinking is not.</p>

                <h2>Can I Explain This Simply?</h2>

                <p>If I can't explain something in plain language — or better yet, implement a small version of it — I probably don't understand it well enough to justify going deeper.</p>

                <p>This is where coding helps. Writing a short script or notebook forces clarity. There's no hiding behind vague intuition once you have to make something run.</p>

                <p>If an idea collapses the moment I try to formalize it, that's a signal to slow down — not move on.</p>

                <h2>Does This Compound?</h2>

                <p>Some things compound quietly. Others don't.</p>

                <p>Learning a core mathematical idea tends to pay dividends across everything else. Learning a niche library often doesn't. That doesn't mean niche tools are bad — just that they're lower priority early on.</p>

                <p>I try to bias toward things that make future learning easier, unlock multiple domains at once, and stay relevant even as tools change.</p>

                <p>If something only helps in one narrow context, I'm comfortable skipping it for now.</p>

                <h2>What Am I Willing to Be Bad At (For Now)?</h2>

                <p>This might be the most important filter.</p>

                <p>You can't be good at everything at once. Trying to be just spreads effort thin. So I've gotten more comfortable explicitly choosing gaps — areas I know I'm weak in, but am intentionally postponing.</p>

                <p>That choice isn't permanent. It's just honest.</p>

                <p>Being deliberate about what I ignore has been as valuable as deciding what to learn.</p>

                <h2>Avoiding the Distraction Loop</h2>

                <p>There's a certain kind of productivity that looks like progress but isn't. Watching videos. Skimming docs. Saving links. Feeling busy.</p>

                <p>When I notice myself doing that, it's usually a sign I need a sharper question — not more information.</p>

                <p>Learning accelerates once you're solving a real problem. Until then, restraint matters more than curiosity.</p>

                <h2>This Will Change — and That's Fine</h2>

                <p>None of this is fixed. As my interests evolve, so will these filters.</p>

                <p>But for now, this framework keeps me grounded. It helps me say no without guilt, focus without panic, and learn without constantly feeling behind.</p>

                <p>In a world with infinite things to learn, attention is the real scarce resource.</p>
