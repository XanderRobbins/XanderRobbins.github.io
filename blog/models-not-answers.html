                <h1>Why I'm More Interested in Models Than Answers</h1>

            </div>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>For a long time, I cared a lot about answers. Getting the right result. Matching the solution. Knowing I was "correct."</p>

                <p>Somewhere along the way — mostly through math and probability — that shifted. Now, I'm far more interested in models than answers.</p>

                <h2>Answers Are Fragile</h2>

                <p>An answer is usually tied to a very specific setup. Change an assumption, tweak a parameter, or move slightly outside the original context, and the answer can fall apart.</p>

                <p>That doesn't make answers useless — it just makes them brittle.</p>

                <p>What started to bother me was how often I could get the "right" answer without really understanding why it was right, or when it would stop being right.</p>

                <h2>Models Force You to Be Honest</h2>

                <p>A model, even a simple one, forces clarity.</p>

                <p>What assumptions are you making? What are you ignoring? What happens when those assumptions fail?</p>

                <p>You can't hide inside a model. If it's wrong, it breaks — sometimes loudly.</p>

                <p>That's uncomfortable, but it's also where learning happens.</p>

                <h2>Math Changed What I Pay Attention To</h2>

                <p>Proof-based math shifted my focus away from results and toward structure. You start caring less about the final line and more about the logic that gets you there.</p>

                <p>Probability did the same thing in a different way. Instead of asking "what will happen?", you ask "under what conditions does this tend to happen?" That subtle shift changes everything.</p>

                <p>Once you start thinking like that, chasing isolated answers feels less satisfying.</p>

                <h2>Models Age Better Than Answers</h2>

                <p>Answers expire quickly. Models don't.</p>

                <p>A numerical result might only be useful today. A good model — even an imperfect one — can be adapted, stress-tested, and reused as conditions change.</p>

                <p>That's why I'm drawn to understanding the shape of problems rather than memorizing outputs. It's also why I'm comfortable sitting with approximation instead of precision when precision isn't justified.</p>

                <h2>This Changes How I Learn</h2>

                <p>When I study something new, I'm less concerned with mastering every technique and more concerned with what assumptions are being made, what problem this is really solving, and where this model breaks down.</p>

                <p>If I can answer those, the details tend to fall into place later.</p>

                <h2>Especially in Uncertain Systems</h2>

                <p>Markets, data, and real-world systems don't reward answer-chasing. They reward people who understand structure, limitations, and uncertainty.</p>

                <p>A clean answer can be comforting. A useful model is more valuable.</p>

                <p>That's the level I'm trying to operate on — even if it means being less certain, more often.</p>
